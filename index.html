					<h2>Master of science in Biomedical Engineering.
					<br />
					<strong>In January 2017, I decided to leave Finland to do something else for a while.</strong></h2>
					<br />
					I worked on Cat Ba island in <strong>Vietnam</strong> as a guide for climbing and kayaking, and then travelled <strong>Middle East</strong> and <strong>South East Asia</strong>.
					<br />
					<br />
					Before this, I have <strong>modelled human interaction and nerve cells using point patterns</strong>, helped sports tracker company <strong>Polar Electro use their data better</strong> and used data to <strong>optimize operations of cruise vessels and LNG tankers to save fuel.</strong>
					<br />
					<br />
                                        Developed a minimum viable product for delivering push notifications to an iOS application.
					<br />
					<br />

					I have worked in research, customer facing analyst, product manager for data and models, and as a software developer for data processing software.
